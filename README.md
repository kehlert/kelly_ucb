If we are betting on a slot machine, then the natural question to ask is “how much
should we bet”? If the probability of winning is p, it turns out that betting a fraction
of our wealth equal to 2p − 1 is an optimal strategy in many senses. However, if
we are faced with many slot machines with unknown probabilities of winning, then
how should we bet, and which slot machines should we bet on? We will present
the Kelly-UCB algorithm, which addresses this more complicated problem. We
will also provide analytic and numerical results regarding the performance of the
Kelly-UCB algorithm.
